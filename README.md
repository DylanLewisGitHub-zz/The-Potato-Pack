The Potato Pack is a data pack for Minecraft: Java Edition that adds new content to improve existing content. Compare it to dog breeds vs a new species.

:warning: The Potato Pack has had a lot of time to shape up lately, but the project is still in early development. You may run into minor issues while using it. Additionally, there will be an ever-growing list of incompatibilities with other data packs.

## Installation

You will need Minecraft 1.18 or higher to use this data pack.

#### Stable releases

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric.svg)

The latest releases of Sodium are published to our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and
[GitHub release](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases) pages. Releases are considered by our team to be
**suitable for general use**, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

Usually, releases will be made available on GitHub slightly sooner than other locations.

#### Bleeding-edge builds (unstable)

[![GitHub build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/gradle-ci/1.17.x/dev)](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

If you are a player who is looking to get your hands on the latest **bleeding-edge changes for testing**, consider
taking a look at the automated builds produced through our [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/actions/workflows/gradle.yml?query=event%3Apush).
This workflow automatically runs every time a change is pushed to the repository, and as such, the builds it produces
will generally reflect the latest snapshot of development.

Bleeding edge builds will often include unfinished code that hasn't been extensively tested. That code may introduce
incomplete features, bugs, crashes, and all other kinds of weird issues. You **should not use these bleeding edge builds**
unless you know what you are doing and are comfortable with software debugging. If you report issues using these builds,
we will expect that this is the case. Caveat emptor.
